description: >
  The annotation process takes one .sam files and produces an annotated version 
  of the .sam files where each read in each file is given an annotation based
  on its coordinates. A three base pair overlap with the coordinates of a known
  genomic feature is required for a read to be annotated. In the event that the
  coordinate range of an aligned read overlaps features in multiple databases,
  the read is annotated with each feature type overlapped, but the read is
  counted toward the expression of only the highest priority feature.
